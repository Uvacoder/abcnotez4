This is an ongoing attempt to organize my links, a directory of 5000+ bookmarks that I use or have used in the past to learn programming, puzzle solving, web development and other intellectually stimulating things. Contains my blogroll, websites, software, Reddit/YouTube subscriptions, podcasts, browser add-ons, Linux tools, and everything.

Links are in the [`src/`](https://github.com/rsapkf/42/tree/main/src) directory.

View all links: [links.rsapkf.xyz](https://links.rsapkf.xyz/)
