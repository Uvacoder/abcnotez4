[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b5c1ffb7-5671-44de-8660-7389068f3649/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rsapkf-links/deploys)

This is an ongoing personal collection of over 5000+ sites and resources that I use or have used in the past to learn programming, puzzle-solving, web development and other intellectually stimulating things, categorized (more or less). Contains my blogroll, websites, software, Reddit/YouTube subscriptions, Medium/DEV.to blogs, IRC channels, HN/Lobste.rs/Stack Overflow/Codepen profiles/articles I follow, podcasts, browser add-ons, Linux tools, Vim/tmux/Emacs plugins I use and everything.

In short, this is my attempt to organize my links, a directory of my "public" bookmarks. Feedback and [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are appreciated.

Links are in the [`src/docs/`](https://github.com/rsapkf/42/tree/main/src/docs) directory.

### Roadmap

- Dynamic website with tagging system and a full featured public API.
- Browser (Firefox/Chromium) extensions to see other similar sites in this collection like the one you're in right now.
- CLI tool to access the collection from the terminal.
