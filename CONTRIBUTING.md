If you like this project and would like to support it, you can do so through [this link.](paypal.com)

To contribute, please read the following guidelines.

## Rules:

If you would like to improve this project by adding/suggesting edits to the contents, pulls requests are always welcomed. Please:

* I am trying to make each list/section as self-contained as I can. So, please feel free to add duplicate links to different lists if necessary.

* Only try to submit free **and quality** resources related to the topics included in the [table of contents](#table-of-contents). Only submit paid resources if they are high quality and you **highly** recommend with a ```paid``` tag at the end. Add paid sites at the end of the list you are trying to add it to.

* If you would like to add a new topic, please make sure to include *at least two* resources that help others learn it.

* Follow this convention: ```[resource](link) - a short description if necessary``` and try to put highly recommended resources first.

* Check spelling and grammar.

## Quality Matters

* **Free** means *entirely* free, not [freemium](), free trial or limited functionality resources. If some resource is freemium or offers a free trial only, mention it with a ```freemium``` tag at the end.

* Your contribution may be denied if the resource does not satisfy necessary curation.

Now let's make this list awesome and even more valuable!
