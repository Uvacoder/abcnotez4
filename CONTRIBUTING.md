# Contributing

If you would like to improve this project by adding/suggesting edits to the contents, pulls requests are welcome. Before you submit your PR, please consider the following guidelines:

- Please do not add duplicate links. Use [GitHub Search](https://github.com/rsapkf/42/search?q=something) if necessary.

- Submit free **and quality** resources. **High quality** paid resources may be submitted with a `paid` tag at the end. **Free** means _entirely_ free, not [freemium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium), free trial or limited functionality resources. If some resource is freemium or offers a free trial, mention it with a `freemium` tag at the end.

- Follow this convention: `[resource](link) - <A short concise description> paid?`.

- Your contribution may be denied if the resource does not satisfy necessary curation.

- We love open source and Unix. If your resource is closed-source and/or Windows/Mac specific, it may have to go through a stricter review.
