### Philosophy
If you are reading this article and considering using Linux, chances are that you know Linux is an open source operating system, meaning unlike operating systems(OSes) like Microsoft Windows or Apple's MacOS, the source code of the Linux Kernel is open source and so are all the OSes written using it. Linux is sometimes called GNU/Linux. This is because the OS is the combination of the Kernel, written by Linus Torvalds, and other utilities provided by the GNU Software Foundation. Understanding this in detail requires a little bit of more reading though ([See]()). The Linux Kernel is distributed under the GPL License and is free to view, modify, copy and redistribute.

### So Many Choices- Distributions
Because the Linux Kernel is open source and due to its nature of License, it can be used to create any kind of OS by making desired modifications to it. This is the reason there are so many distributions of different Linux OSes. For Example, Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Manjaro, Gentoo, Fedora, etc but how do you go about making a proper choice when you don't have any experience with Linux? In this article, there is everything you need to understand.

#### Ease of Installation
The most popular, easiest to use and often recommended distribution for new users is Ubuntu. Ubuntu is backed by Canonical LTD, UK. The easy installation procedure and its nature of "working out of the box" (See [Hardware Compatibility](#hardware-compatibility)) makes it the easiest to use distro. It can be installed with a graphical interface called Ubiquity. But not all distros are that easy to install. Debian GNU/Linux can be installed using both a graphical installer as well as command line interface. It is backed by the Debian Foundation and its values somehow differ from that of Ubuntu. All Debian ISOs come with entirely free software, including the drivers required for wifi chips to work, or other hardware components. So you might be required to download required drivers individually along with the debian iso for a complete installation. Some distros are more linient towards non-free drivers. Other easier to use and install distros include Fedora, OpenSUSE, and their derivatives. Distros like Arch and Gentoo are much harder to install. These distros do not come with any graphical installers and you are expected to configure your system using the command line. However, the installation instructions are provided in their amazing wikis(See [ArchWiki]() and [GentooWiki]()). If you can follow a recipe, you can install Arch or any other distro. Just make sure to do a lot of reading about topics you don't know about(e.g. Partitions, Shell Commmands, package managers, bootloader, BIOS/UEFI etc). I recommend using an easier distro for at least 2-3 weeks to learn these topics before jumping right into Arch or Gentoo.

#### Stability
Ubuntu and distros based on it(Pop!OS) are very stable. Ubuntu comes in two types- LTS(Long Term Support) and Normal versions. The LTS versions are supported for 5 years and normal versions are supported for one year. The latest LTS Ubuntu version is 18.04. However, you can also use the latest 19.04 if you want.









#### - How It Looks- Desktop Environments
Desktop Environments like GNOME, KDE, MATE, Xfce, LXQt, etc define how the interface of the operating system looks like. For example,
