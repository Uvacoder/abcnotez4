This is an ongoing personal collection of over 5000+ sites and resources that I use or have used in the past to learn programming, puzzle-solving, web development and other intellectually stimulating things, categorized (more or less). Contains my blogroll, websites, software, Reddit/YouTube subscriptions, Medium/DEV.to blogs, IRC channels, HN/Lobste.rs/StackOverflow/Codepen profiles/articles I follow, podcasts, browser add-ons, Linux tools, Vim/tmux/Emacs plugins I use and everything.

In short, this is my attempt to organize my links, a directory of my "public" bookmarks. Feedback and [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are appreciated.

**Disclaimer**: The categorization of resources and software that I list here are for personal reference only. Not every open source software out there is more secure than other proprietary options. Please do a thorough research before using any of this stuff.

This is a lifelong project and here are some things on the long-term roadmap:

- dynamic website with tagging system and full featured public API for this project.
- browser (Firefox / Chromium) extensions to see other similar sites in this collection like the one you're in right now.
- access to resources from the terminal.
