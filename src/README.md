This is an ongoing attempt to organize my links, a directory of 5000+ bookmarks that I use or have used in the past to learn programming, puzzle solving, web development and other intellectually stimulating things. Contains my blogroll, websites, software, Reddit/YouTube subscriptions, podcasts, browser add-ons, Linux tools, and everything.
